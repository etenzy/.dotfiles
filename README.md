# My personal dotfiles for OSX

Add first start open console and execute

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

Create ssh keys

```bash
# Add -N '' if you don't want a passphrase
ssh-keygen -o -a 100 -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 -C "yourmail@provider.tld"

# If you are using a legacy system that doesn't support the Ed25519 algorithm, use:
ssh-keygen -o -a 100 -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -C "yourmail@provider.tld"

eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

ssh-add
```

If youâ€™re using macOS Sierra 10.12.2 or later, to load the keys automatically and store the passphrases in the Keychain, you need to configure your ~/.ssh/config file:

```
Host *
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  UseKeychain yes
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa # Keep any old key files if you want
```
